        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>RFID Tag Geolocation System</h3>
        <p>Utilized a novel method typically found in radar systems to facilitate accurate geolocation of passive UHF RFID tags for retail applications. I also developed an algorithm for matching tags with shopping carts when placed within them, by using proximity, and the motion paths of the item tags along with a tag placed on the shopping cart. </p>
        <h3>Speed Camera Data Science Project (Underway)</h3>
        <p>Extracted Data from nearly 10 years of traffic violations and Collisions in order to develop a dataset for speed camera revenue, and collision prevention. I then designed a predictive ML model to forecast future revenue and collision prevention statistics for each camera in the New York City network</p>
