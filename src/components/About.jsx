            I'm a full stack developer with a strong background in backend, app, and web development, 
            data science, and machine learning. My technical expertise spans modern frameworks and technologies 
            including React, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms.

            As co-founder of Anatta, I led a team of four to generate over $100,000 in revenue within 
            the first year of operation. I managed operations, logistics, and coordinated pop-up events 
            to help local designers launch their clothing brands.

            I'm a Computer Science graduate from Hunter College, with a passion for 
            entrepreneurship, photography, fashion, architecture, and social impact. I'm excited about 
            contributing my skills and experience to meaningful projects that make a difference.
