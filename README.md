# Personal Resume Site

This repository contains the source code for Antonio Iadicicco's resume website hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Development

Changes can be previewed locally by opening `index.html` in a browser. The site uses a small amount of JavaScript for animations and responsive navigation.

Styles are defined in `style.css`. On screens narrower than 600px, the navigation collapses into a sidebar that can be toggled with the menu button in the header.

## Deployment

Pushes to the `main` branch are automatically published through GitHub Pages. No additional build steps are required.
